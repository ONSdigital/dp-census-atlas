An end-of-terrace house is part of a terraced development but only shares one common wall.\n\nFlats (Apartments) and maisonettes:\nAn apartment is another word for a flat. A maisonette is a 2-storey flat.",

All other rooms, for example, living rooms, studies, bedrooms, separate dining rooms and rooms that can only be used for storage are included. Please note that the 2011 Census question included kitchens, conservatories and utility rooms while excluding rooms that can only be used for storage.
