          "long_desc": "Whether a household's accommodation is overcrowded, ideally occupied or under-occupied. This is calculated by comparing the number of rooms the household requires to the number of available rooms.\n\nThe number of rooms the household requires uses a formula which states that:\n\n* one-person households require three rooms comprised of two common rooms and one bedroom\n* two-or-more person households require a minimum of two common rooms and a bedroom for each person inline with the Bedroom Standard\n\nPeople who should have their own room according to the Bedroom Standard are:\n\n1. married or cohabiting couple\n2. single parent\n3. person aged 16 years and over\n4. pair of same-sex persons aged 10 to 15 years\n5. person aged 10 to 15 years paired with a person under 10 years of the same sex\n6. pair of children aged under 10 years, regardless of their sex\n7. person aged under 16 years who cannot share a bedroom with someone in 4, 5 or 6 above\n\nAn occupancy rating of:\n\n* -1 or less implies that a household\u2019s accommodation has fewer rooms than required (overcrowded)\n* +1 or more implies that a household\u2019s accommodation has more rooms than required (under-occupied)\n* 0 suggests that a household\u2019s accommodation has an ideal number of rooms\n\nThe number of rooms is taken from Valuation Office Agency (VOA) administrative data for the first time in 2021. The number of rooms is recorded at the address level, whilst the 2011 Census recorded the number of rooms at the household level.  This means that for households that live in a shared dwelling, the available number of rooms are counted for the whole dwelling in VOA, and not each individual household. \n\nVOA\u2019s definition of a room does not include bathrooms, toilets, halls or landings, kitchens, conservatories or utility rooms. All other rooms, for example, living rooms, studies, bedrooms, separate dining rooms and rooms that can only be used for storage are included. Please note that the 2011 Census question included kitchens, conservatories and utility rooms while excluding rooms that can only be used for storage. To adjust for the definitional difference, the number of rooms required is deducted from the actual number of rooms it has available, and then 1 is added.",
